###Comments
First off, THANK YOU for all the help. I would have completely failed this assignment if you hadn't been so patient with me and answered all of my questions. I have a few questions from this assignment to help me best understand it all a little bit more.
-I noticed that for when I was adding elements, in the line with the appendChild, it didn't work if I go the parent element from an ID, only from a class. Why is this?
-Again with the appendChild line, what exactly does the [0] reference and is it entirely necessary?
-I originally tried to have my last function in the custom branch add an image with text highlight('select'), but that wouldn't work. Not sure why but would love to go over that so I can use it in the future.
-I also wanted, originally, to have clicking on the main image toggle between two images but couldn't figure it out, even when googling it. Can we go over this in class, perhaps?
-For events, how do you limit it to only doing the event one time? I notice when I click or mouseover items with listeners multiple times it just continues to reenact the event.
